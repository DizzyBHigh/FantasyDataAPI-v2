## <a name="api-key"></a>API Key
In order to use this library, the very first step will be to acquire an API key. There
are multiple options, so it's best to look at the pricing model. If you're just starting
out, it's likely best to start with a free trial or a developer key.

Visit the [FantasyData developer site](http://developer.fantasydata.com) and click Sign
Up to create a new account if you don't already have one.

Once you have an account, you will need to get your key. Sign in to [FantasyData](http://developer.fantasydata.com/)
and visit the [developer page](http://developer.fantasydata.com/developer/). On the top
left of the page you will see your key. Click "Show Key" and copy that key. You'll need
that whenever creating a client. For details on how to create a client, visit the
[Client Documentation](CLIENTS.md).

## <a name="resources"></a>Resources
The Service itself provides a number of Resources. Below you will find links to the
service documentation as well as a description of each Resource that we have implemented
from the service in the [Client Documentation](CLIENTS.md#resources).

The enums themselves are derived from the service, and the original values are documented

The dictionary not only contains the keys to the various data elements, but also a
description of what those elements are, which can be quite handy.
